Mr. Abraham\r\nBlackburn, a colored man 35 years old, had\r\nbeen in the employ of the late Rev. John\r\nForsyth D.D., since March, 1878. He has\r\nalways been sober, industrious, and reliable.\r\nAdded to this Abraham is intelligent and\r\ncourteous. \r\nIn August 1862, Abraham, his mother, three\r\nsisters, and three brothers were sold into Rich-\r\nmond, VA., to Andrew Blackburn, a large slave-\r\nholder. They were by him carried to New\r\nMarket, Jefferson County, Tenn. Abraham\r\nBlackburn, was a mere boy. At New\r\nMarket the children were all separated from\r\ntheir mother, she being sold again. From New\r\nMarket Blackburn, the purchaser, took the\r\nchildren to Henderson County, North Carolina,\r\nwhere they were one by one separated from each\r\nother, Abraham reaching the North some\r\nyears ago. The mother was never seen or\r\nheard from by any of her children until last\r\nnight.\r\nFrom the time Abraham reached the estate\r\nof manhood he has felt a keen interest in the\r\nwelfare of his mother, and has long wanted to\r\nfind out where she was and to see her. Of late\r\nyears, he has adopted various plans which he\r\nthought would lead to the restoration of his\r\nmother to him. For the last four years and\r\nsix months this dutiful son has been follow-\r\ning up every clew that he had a idea would\r\nlead to the learning of his mother\'s where-\r\nabouts. He failed repeatedly, until yesterday.\r\nThen he received a letter from his aged\r\nmother\'s own hand. It now transpires that\r\nthe mother has resided in Knoxville, Tenn.,\r\never since the close of the War of the Rebellion.\r\nDuring the long search 236 letter have been\r\nwritten with the hope of finding this young\r\nman\'s mother. That there will be rejoicing\r\nwhen the reunited mother and son meet goes\r\nwithout saying. The mother is alone in the\r\nSouth, except for a sister Eliza, who resides at\r\nRichmond, Va. Abraham has written a letter\r\nto his mother expressing the wish that she come\r\nhere and spend the winter, and then she can\r\ngo back South, if she so desires, in the spring.\r\nThere appears to be no doubt that the mother\r\nwill avail herself of the invitation extended\r\nby her dutiful son, and that she will reach\r\nNewburg at an early date. Of the children\r\nwho were sold with Abraham Blackburn, at\r\nRichmond, in 1862, the latter has track still of\r\nthe following: William, who is (younger) at\r\nSyracuse, N.Y.:  Mary (older) in South Car-\r\nolina: Clara, in Rutherford County, South\r\nCarolina.\r\nIt is the purpose of Abraham Blackburn to\r\nremain at the house of the widow of Dr. For-\r\nsyth during the the coming winter, where he will\r\nbe an able assistant, as he always was, to the\r\nRev. Dr. Forsyth, who valued his services very\r\nhighly. In conversation with Abraham, it\r\ntranspires that Dr. Forsyth did good work\r\nduring the last few years in assisting the former\r\nin his search for his mother. And the young\r\nman speaks in high praise of his late employer\r\nfor the benevolent and kindly interest he took\r\nin assisting him in this direction. Above all,\r\nAbraham returns his grateful thanks to God\r\nfor reuniting him with his mother whom he\r\nloves so well. -- Newburg (N.Y.)

J., has\r\nbeen searching for her lost daughter, and she\r\nis searching still. Tears have often flowed\r\nover the woes of Uncle Tom, but her story is\r\nsadder and more pathetic than the one Mrs.\r\nStowe so feelingly told. Mrs. Bashop is tall\r\nand slender, and her sad face shows the re-\r\nfinement which the colored women in the\r\naristocratic old families of the South so often\r\npossessed. At the Colbath House, in Morris-\r\ntown, she is in charge of one of\r\nthe most important departments. Mrs.\r\nBashop belonged to Dick Christian, a\r\nwealthy country gentlemen who lived near\r\nCharles City Court-house, Va. Mr. Christian\r\nbecame involved in debt and his slaves\r\nwere placed on the block. Among them were\r\nMrs. Bashop and her 12-year-old daughter\r\nPatience. \"She was a bright little girl,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Bashop yesterday, \"and when we\r\nwere taken into the market-place to he sold I\r\nprayed that wherever we might go we would\r\ngo together.\" But her wish was not to be\r\nfulfilled. She was sold first first and and Ben Davis, a\r\nprofessional negro trader, bought her. The\r\nlittle girl was sold to a stranger. Mrs. Bashop\r\nfell on her knees before Davis and\r\nimplored him to buy her daughter from\r\nthe stranger. Though hardened by the con-\r\nstant sight of such scenes, Davis\' heart was\r\ntouched by the agony of the mother. He\r\nwent to the stranger and offered to buy the\r\nlittle girl but the latter refused to sell\r\nher and went away a few hours later\r\nwith his purchase. Mrs. Bashop has never\r\nseen her daughter since but her own history\r\nsince then shows how faithful is a mother\'s\r\nheart even though it beats in the humble bosom of a slave. Mrs. Bashop was carried to Charlestown, S.C., and sold again.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1859, and already the rumblings of the coming war were heard. Slaves changed masters rapidly then, and Mrs. Bashop was sold from one to another, passing into Alabama and Mississippi, being owned at Carrollton in the latter state when emancipation came. But during all her involuntary wanderings she had no thought but of her lost daughter, Patience. She begged each master to write back to Charles City Court-house, Va., and endeavor to discover something of her. Some complied, others did not, but no news ever came of the missing girl. When she was free Mrs. Bashop began the search on her own account. For a long time she could not away from Mississippi. She could earn but little money; not enough to take her back to Virginia, where her daughter had been sold, but she wrote letters and friends wrote others for her.\r\n\r\nAt last she saved money enough to reach Virginia, but the visit increased only her sorrow. Her former master was dead and the war had swept away old landmarks and old recollections. No one knew anything of her daughter, she could not learn the name of the man who bought her, but the mother\'s heart was faithful still. She sewed and she cooked and she did housework. She denied herself to save money for her search. She traveled through Virginia and she went through Kentucky. She visited South Carolina and the far South, and everywhere she hunted for her daughter. She put advertisements in the papers; she paid the colored preachers to state the case in their churches before their congregations, in order that one person might tell the story to another, and thus spread it through the country, but still no news came of the lost girl. [undecipherable sentence]\r\n\r\n[undecipherable] why not? Did you ever see a mouth that resembled an oyster more than hers?\"\r\nmight have came to the North after the war and she renewed her search in New York. She found a home here and for many months she hunted through the great city. She repeated her advertisements in the newspapers and she asked the colored preachers here as she had in the South to help her and still no news came of the lost girl. Though twenty years had now gone the mother was as faithful to her child\'s memory as ever and searched for her as eagerly and as patiently as she did when first she was free. Finally she settled at Morristown and has for many years been employed at the Colbath House There she intends to remain, but she is still searching for the lost girl.'),(28776,3113,'Item',52,0,'I would like to know the whereabouts of my\r\nhusband, Stephen Low.

They were separated when he was 7 years old, he having been sold by their master, William Hobbston, in Kentucky, to Dr. Henderson of Osceola, Ark. When the war came on Easton ran away and fell into the care of soldiers. After the war he came to Indiana and worked for years at Rushville. He then removed to Indianapolis, working for three years at the stockyards.\r\nThis was the story Easton told C. G. Kumler, foreman at the Nordyke-Marmon Works. As to the name of the town in Kentucky where Hobbston lived, all Easton could say was that it was something like Lovelace. Kumler became interested in the man’s search and learned that there was a Lovelaceville in Kentucky. He also got information that V. S. Lovelace lived there. Writing to him, he soon received a reply, in which Lovelace said he had been a resident there for fifty years, and knew many persons whom Easton had mentioned. Among those was Duke Robertson, who still remained on his old plantation on the south side of Mayfield Creek. Kumler asked Easton if he remembered the creek.\r\n“Yes.” replied Easton. “I can remember that. My mother used to wash the clothes in a creek and dry them on the bank, and I used to go swimming in it.”\r\n“What was the named of it?”\r\n“I can’t remember.”\r\n“If I told you could you remember it?”\r\n“Yes, I think I could; but am not sure.”\r\n“Well, was it Mayfield Creek?”\r\n“Yes, sir; that was it, and it had a bend in it called Walnut Bend, where I used to fish.\r\nKumler then wrote again to Lovelace, inquiring about Clara Hobbston, as John called his mother. The answer of Mr. Lovelace was: “The woman you seek was Clara Clounch. Clara’s husband was and is William Hobbs, not Hobbston. She and Bill are both alive yet and live in Paducah, Ky. They had hard times during the war. They were living a mile from this place, peaceable, law-abiding citizens, but were awakened in the dead of night by bushwhackers. Bill was shot in his cabin and made a cripple for the balance of his life.”\r\nThese letters from his old home aroused great hope in Easton’s breast. He could hardly wait for a letter to his mother to reach Paducah, and wanted to go immediately to her. Kumler, however, advised patience, and asked Easton if he had any particular mark by which he could be identified. “Yes, sir,” he said, “I was born with two thumbs, and one was cut away when I was about six weeks old. You can see the scar on my hand where it was.” It was by this scar the mother identified her son, who is with her in Paducah.\r\n'),(30190,3290,'Item',50,0,'\"Uncle Levi\" and \"Aunt Aggie\" reunited and remarried after 40 years'),(30191,3290,'Item',49,0,'Other (Newspaper Article)'),(30192,3290,'Item',41,0,'They were separated in Morgan County, Georgia, in 1844.'),(30193,3290,'Item',48,0,'Butler Weekly Times (Butler, MO)'),(30194,3290,'Item',40,0,'January 30, 1884'),(30198,3290,'Item',37,0,'Jesse Nasta '),(30199,3290,'Item',45,0,'Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

The father is a man of remarkable age and according to a son who recently visited here, has seen 127 summers. \r\n\r\nHenry Tolliver, when but a boy of 9, was sold on a southern auction block in Davis County, Missouri. This was the last he saw of his parent. He ran away from his master about the time of the outbreak of the war and came to Des Moines. He enlisted in the sixteenth United States colored infantry, served through the war and then came back to Des Moines and has since lived here. He is now a man of 64 years and the story of how he learned again of the whereabouts of his father reads like a romance.\r\n\r\nA short time ago a colored man—a tramp—came to Mr. Tolliver’s home on Fremont street. Mrs. Tolliver gave him something to eat. The visitor asked her name. Mrs. Tolliver told him. He said he knew an old man of that name living at Leavenworth and that he was known as Alfred Tolliver. Mrs. Tolliver said at once this was the name of her husband’s father. Mr. Tolliver was working south of the river at the time. Mrs. Tolliver kept the stranger until her husband returned, and the latter, after making minute inquiries, was assured he had at last discovered the whereabouts of his father. He wrote to Leavenworth for confirmation and received a reply that removed all doubt on the subject. \r\n\r\nEarly this week Mr. Tolliver was visited by his brother Alexander of Tonganoxie, Kans. The two brothers had not met since 1862. From his brother Mr. Tolliver learned that his father was in good health and was able to walk about. He has planned to leave for Levenworth in a short time and there will doubtless be a family reunion well worth witnessing. \r\n\r\nWhile Alexander Tolliver was here this week the two brothers called on Capt. Amos Brandt at the state house and told him their remarkable story. Mr. Henry Tolliver had a son in Captain Brandt’s company of colored troops in the Spanish-American war.\r\n'),(30374,3237,'Item',52,0,'Romantic Lives Of Slave Couple.\r\nA marriage license was issued at Hagerstown last week to Robert Anderson, of Weverton, aged 74 years, and Ida Pryor, of Staunton, aged 67, both colored.

Seven years later after five children had been born to them, the father was sold to another master and taken to Tennessee, 700 miles away, and the family broken up.

It was a reunion of a mother and son torn apart by the cruel conditions of slavery laws thirty-three years ago. The soldier, who through the circumstances of war had carried the child on his saddle away from its birthplace and the chief factor in bringing the man and his mother together after a separation of a third of a century, stood by and wept in sympathy. \r\n\r\nIt was a surprise to the son, and the aged woman had traveled night and day to aid their benefactor in carrying out his plan of a \"Christmas gift of a mother,\" long believed by him to be dead. She brought him a simple present, a few magnolias, symbolic of the South, where she had suffered so much, but which she still loved. \r\n\r\nYoung\'s Romantic Career\r\nDowen Young, the colored man who fondled the withered hand of his mother as she lay upon a sofa, too much exhausted to stand, and too happy to sleep, is a doorkeeper at the main entrance to the stock exchange, where he has been for four years. He is now about 48 years of age, and married, and he had not heard from any member of his family since he was eight years old, though for years he tried to get some trace of his mother; but, hearing she was dead some years ago, he gave up hope, and when his soldier friend, who had never lost track of him, told him he would some day help him find her, it was without hope that he listened and thanked him. \r\n\r\nThe incidents in the life of the three chief figures in this drama are a story breathing of the cruelties of slavery, the inhumanity of men, the circumstances of war, the abiding affection between a [indecipherable] mother and her son, and the stranger, but true friendship of a generous man for a little slave to whom he gave freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen the civil war broke out Margaret Young, a negro woman, and her three children lived on the Arthur estate in Clay county, Missouri, near the town of Liberty. They were all slaves of John Arthur. Her husband, Jesse Young, had died a few years before. He belonged to Mrs. Arthur, whose maiden name was Young, and was one of the many human chattels that made up her dower. Margaret had been the slave of a neighboring planter, Adam Pence, and she was known as Margaret Pence. In 1854 John Arthur bought her from Pence, and she was married to Jesse Young. They had three children, Dowen, Walter, and Susie. In 1861 it became apparent to the slave owners of the Missouri counties bordering on the Kansas line that, in order to save the value of their slaves, they must sell them off to the traders who supplied the Southern markets. Many of the negroes had run away, being assisted in escaping by one Fred Fritzlein, a mulatto. His particular field of operations was the Arthur and adjoining plantations. John Arthur therefore sought for and found a purchaser for his able-bodied men and women slaves in one Jim Adams, a noted dealer in negroes. Margaret had longed and hoped for freedom. Many of her fellow servants had made their escape, but she could not desert her little ones, not realizing that she might at any time be forced to separate from them, and doomed to a life of toil in the Southern cotton fields. \r\n\r\nMother and Children Separated.\r\nMargaret was sold to the slave trade, and separated from her children, the eldest 8 years, and the youngest a girl 3 years of age. \r\n\r\n\"And how we cried, mother,\" said the oldest son to her yesterday, \"when they took you away.\"\r\n\r\nShe was joined to the slave gang, chained and guarded to prevent their escape, which started by a circuitous route to avoid Union soldiers to the South. After much roundabout traveling, Adams reached Arkansas, and was soon inside the Confederate lines, where he was perfectly safe. From there he hurried on by direct route to New Orleans, which was the best slave market. From the block in the slave pens of that city he sold his gang. Margaret was among them, and described in the catalogue as follows: \r\nMargaret: prime: Christian: 26\r\nShe was sold to Dr. Walter Mathews for $1,800. It was the value slave dealers placed upon Christian slaves and so advertising them moved Whittier to say: A Christian! going: gone! Who bids for God\'s own image? for his grace Which that poor victim of the market-place\r\nHath in her suffering won?\r\n\r\nBoys Join Northern Army.\r\nAfter the sale of the mother the children were placed with an old auntie, and as soon as they were strong enough put to work in the hemp and corn fields. It was while the two boys were so employed that Colonel Jennison, the famous Kansas Jayhawker, rider and raider and a terror to all the border slave-owners, and a company of troopers made one of their periodical forays into Clay county and, reaching the Arthur plantation, gathered in a few thoroughbred horses and five boys, carrying them off to the steamboat landing near by. The women of the Arthur household followed, and at the landing pleaded with the boys to return, but freedom was now very plainly in sight for them, and they refused. The boat was steaming up stream and Dowen and Walter Young met his friend and benefactor, who was a sergeant major of the regiment to which the troopers belonged. \r\n\r\nAfter they arrived at Fort Leavenworth the boys attached themselves to an Illinois regiment, and soon became very useful. In this same summer of \'64 Price, the Confederate general, planned his last raid into Missouri, entering the state below Pilot-Knob, and menacing St. Louis. The Illinois regiment was ordered to that point, and later down the Iron Mountain road. The little negro boys made the campaign, and remained with the regiment until it was mustered out at Camp Butler, Springfield, Ill. One of the boys, Walter, went to Oquawka, Ill., with Captain John Wilson, but from there all trace of him has been lost.\r\n\r\nCame to Chicago in \'68\r\nDowen was taken from Springfield to Ottawa, Ill., where he was provided with a home in the family of the late John H. Manley. In 1868 he came to this city, and has lived here ever since. He has always had employment, being a quiet, sober, industrious man. Many years ago he identified himself with the Bethel African M. E. Church. He also belongs to the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, Western Star lodge, No. 1,443. He was for three years janitor of the Jones school on Plymouth place, and twelve years behind the oyster bar in the restaurant of the old Burke\'s European hotel.\r\n\r\nSusan, the sister, remained with the Arthur family for some time after they removed to Kansas City. She is now 41 years of age, and until this year has never heard from any member of her family, but through the same benefactor, she will soon see her now aged mother again.\r\n\r\nAfter the mother had been sold, she remained in New Orleans about two years, when she was taken to Mobile, Ala. where she has lived ever since. For years she has longed for some word from home, from the old place, and the three little children that she had left there. She could not read nor write, for it had been a crime to teach a slave to read even the Bible.\r\n\r\nShe married again, and the new cares of a growing family helped the years to slip away. Many Christmas days have come and gone since she, then a young woman, commenced her new life in the South. Mature womanhood came, and then age, and the old, old times and her former home in Missouri seemed like a dream to her. A few weeks ago the family by whom she is occasionally employed read in their evening paper that information of a person answering her description was wanted. She had the inquiry answered, was sent for, and proved to be the long-lost Margaret Young, mother of Dowen, Walker, and Susie Young.\r\n\r\nMother and Son Meet.\r\nThursday last at midnight Mrs. Nelson, for that is now her name, was put aboard the north-bound train in Mobile, Ala. She was going to visit her son Dowen in Chicago, and then after a few weeks to journey on to Kansas City, to visit her daughter, Mrs. Susan Reeves, and her brothers, who were sold about the same time, but returned North at the close of the war. She had a letter from the general agent of the Mobile and Ohio railroad at Mobile, addressed to conductors and porters, which insured her every attention. She reached Chicago at noon and was met by her benefactor, who took her immediately to her son\'s home. Dowen Young had been apprised of his friend\'s intention to visit him Christmas day, and when he saw him from his window walking toward the house he did not take much notice of the tall colored woman behind him. She followed into the room. \r\n\r\n\"Dowen, do you know this woman?\" asked his friend. \r\n\r\n(Continued on 2nd.

Tears have often flowed over the woes of Uncle Tom, but her story is sadder and more pathetic than the one Mrs. Stowe so feelingly told. \r\nMrs. Bashop is tall and slender, and her sad face shows the refinement which the col-ored women in the aristocratic old families of the South so often possessed. At the Col-bath House, in Morristown, where she is in charge of one of the most important depart-ments, she receives the implicit confidence and respect of her employers and of all others who know her. \r\nMrs. Bashop belonged to Dick Christian, a wealthy country gentleman, who lived near Charles City Court House, Va. But like many other Virginia country gentlemen of those days, Mr. Christian became involved in debt and his slaves were placed on the block. Among them were Mrs. Bashop and her twelve-year-old daughter, Patience.\r\n\"She was a bright little girl,\" said Mrs. Bashop yesterday, \"and when we were taken into the market-place to be sold I prayed that wherever we might go we would go to-gether.\"\r\nBut her wish was not fulfilled. She was sold first, and Ben Davis, a professional negro trader, bought her. Then the little girl was placed on the block, and while the weeping mother stood by she was sold to a stranger. Mrs. Bashop fell on her knees be-fore Davis and implored him to buy her daughter from the stranger.\r\nThough hardened by the constant sight of such scenes, Davis\'s heart was touched by the agony of the mother. He went to the stranger and offered to buy the little girl, but the latter refused to sell her, and went away a few hours later with his purchase.\r\nMrs. Bashop has never seen her daughter since, but her own history since then shows how faithful is a mother\'s heart even though it beats in the humble bosom of a slave.\r\nMrs. Bashop was carried to Charleston, S.C., and sold again. That was in 1859, and already the rumblings of the coming war were heard. Slaves changed masters rapidly then, and Mrs. Bashop was sold from one to another, passing into Alabama and Missis-sippi, being owned at Carrollton, in the latter State, when emancipation came. But during all her involuntary wanderings she had no thought but of her lost daughter, Patience. She begged each master to write back to Charles City Court-House, Va., and endeavor to discover something of her. Some com-plied. Others did not. But no news ever came of the missing girl. \r\nWhen she was free Mrs. Bashop began the search on her own account. For a long time she could not get away from Mississippi. She could earn but little money; not enough to take her back to Virginia, where her daugh-ter had been sold, but she wrote letters and friends wrote others for her. \r\nAt last she saved money enough to reach Virginia, but the visit added only to her sor-row. Her former master was dead and the war had swept away old landmarks and old recollections. No one knew anything of her daughter. She could not even ascertain the name of the man who bought her. But the mother\'s heart was faithful still. She sewed and she cooked and she did housework. She denied herself to save money for her search. \r\nShe travelled through Virginia and she went into Kentucky. She visited South Car-olina and the far South, and everywhere she hunted for her daughter. She put advertise-ments in the papers. She paid the colored preachers to state the case in their churches before their congregations, in order that one person might tell the story to another and thus spread it throughout the country.\r\nBut still no news came of the lost girl.\r\nThough the years passed and the little Patience, if alive, was a woman now, the mother still hoped and worked. Then she thought that her daughter may have come to the North after the war and she renewed her search in New York. She found a home here, and for many months she hunted through the great city. She repeated her advertise-ments in the newspapers and asked the colored preachers here, as she had in the South, to help her, and still no news came of the lost girl. \r\nThough twenty years had now gone, the mother was as faithful to her child\'s memory as ever, and searched for her as eagerly and as patiently as she did when first she was free.\r\nFinally she settled at Morristown, and has for many years been employed at the Colbath House. There she intends to remain. But she is still searching for the lost girl.\r\nYesterday, knowing the power of a great newspaper, she came to New York and asked THE WORLD to help her. She is an old woman now, and little Patience, if alive, is middle aged, but she still thinks that she will find her daughter. \r\nAs the tears flowed down her face and dropped on the folds of her thick, black veil, she said:\r\n\"I would know her the moment I saw her, and I will find her yet.\"'),(33475,3582,'Item',52,0,'INFORMATION WANTED. \r\nInformation is wanted relative to the\r\npresent address of George W.
